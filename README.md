# A Worked Example of Fokker-Planck Based Active Inference
This repo contains the code necessary to reproduce the figures and results from Koudahl & de Vries, 'A Worked Example of Fokker-Planck Based Active Inference', as published at IWAI 2020.
The code is written in large parts to be consistent with the notation in the paper and to function as a didactic tool for understanding the NESS interpretation of the Free Energy Principle. As such it is not an optimised implementation.

If you find this repo useful, please cite the paper :)
